<h2>About Ada</h2>

 <p><img src="images/ada.jpg" width=250 hspace="10" vspace="5" align="left" />I am a natural psychic medium. While everyone can talk to those on the other side, sometimes people like me help you to hear what they have to tell you.  In addition my mediumship abilities, I do Chakra Energy Clearings with a technique my Spirit Guides gave me a couple of years ago.  With the aid of the telephone, computer and Skype, I work with individuals internationally and all over the US.  
</p>
 <p>Over my life I've done many things. Most I have taught myself to do by observing others work.  In many ways I've been a Jackie of all trades, which has helped me to gain the courage to develop and enhance my natural psychic abilities over the years. Because of this, a part of my personal philosophy is "we can do anything if we but put our minds to it."    
</p>
 <p>Someone used to tell me life was an amazing book and we never knew what pages would unfold before us. I found that to be true after a series of life changing events led me to accept what had always been a part of me- my psychic and mediumship abilities. After accepting my abilities as a real part of who I am, then came the task of learning what they were. In this I am forever a student. One never stops learning once the path has been started.  Spirit often leads us right to where we need to be to learn more for the next step in our Soul Journey.  
</p>
 <p>I am what can be termed a Spirit taught individual.  I frequently asked for signs and Spirit/God directed me to the right material to read, listen to and individuals to observe.  It was what Spirit felt best for me. Over the years I've seen that God taught me in the ways that I learn best.  After several years of walking down the path of learning and understanding, it is my understanding that Spirit has lead me to help others. It is my honor to now offer my mediumship services and Energy Healing/Clearing abilities to help others. I can help you receive messages from loved ones who have passed over and clear out energy blockages on this earth to help you move forward with your life in a more positive way. 
</p>
 <p>Life is about living it to the fullest. Understanding and in using our intuitive abilities is part of that fullness and richness. Spirit set my path in life to aid others in understanding our intuitive abilities. No one's path in life is exactly the same as another's and each of us gets here by different means. I feel my personal path is to help me to guide and understand other's perspectives on their paths. I hope to help aid you to reconcile that these occurrences as natural and  wonderful miracles which lead us to where we are now. </p>
 <p align="center"><strong>Giving Back</strong></p> 

 <p>We all need to give back in whatever ways we can. It is part of being grateful and moving forward that I feel very strongly about. If you have been blessed in life, give back where and when you can...
</p>
 <p>I would like to help and give back to those who have lost loved ones on active duty in the military. Their passing can be a direct result of warfare or an indirect result from one of many complications. If you are a surviving widow, widower, fianc&eacute;, mother, father, grandparent or child (must be over 18) of a fallen soldier, I will gladly donate a one hour reading to try and help contact your loved one who was lost in or as a result of conflict. This offer is not solely for those in the USA. If you are able to speak English or make translation arrangements, I will donate one hour of my time to help you contact your loved ones. Unfortunately I cannot 100% guarantee contact with your soldier, but I will do my very best to make contact possible.  
  </p>
 <p>Please understand that grief has its own personal timing.  It is best to wait six months before contacting me for a reading. </p>
