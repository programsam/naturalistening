<p>We're all born intuitive to one degree or another. It wasn't until I was in
	my mid 30's that I started studying and learning how one's intuition can work.
	Yes, I'm a Psychic Medium, but you don't see that as a career or learning
	choice for college where I come from at least. I'm Spirit taught, which means
	I've been and am being led to learning by SPirit/Creator as well as my Guides
	and Angels. Being a Medium means I can communicate with those in the world of
	Spirit. I call our loved ones that have passed over, our Spirit Folks.</p>

<p>If you would like a bit of time to talk with your Spirit folks, please wait
	until 3 months have passed, at least. That way you can grieve the initial
	stages and be more able to understand their messages. Please bear in mind
	they will be sending you messages through signs, small and large, as well as
	synchronicities in the mean time. If you are grieving a loss, PLEASE take
	care of you by resting, eating right and letting yourself work through the
	difficult myriad of emotions you will be experiencing.</p>

<p>Psychic matters are a bit different regarding timing. Please know that we
	cannot work around life lessons and I don't give lottery numbers, LOL.</p>

<p>With any reading, PLEASE ALWAYS have paper, pen and pencil ready as well as
	 being in a good place to help you work through the answers you will get.
	 They may not always be everything that you want, but they will be what you
	 need at that time.</p>

<p>Regarding Chakra clearings, this is energy work. Before a session just make
	sure you have a bit of extra time to settle in before I call. You won’t need
	a pen or paper for this, but you will need a few extra minutes after a
	session. During an energy, session you may feel cold, hot, tingling, tired,
	emotional or even a tad dizzy. This is all normal for a session like this.
	Please give yourself time to adjust back after a session. Just sit and rest
	for a few extra minutes. After a session, drink a LOT of fluids, no
	carbonated beverages and no caffeine heavy drinks. Water and juices are the
	best afterwards.</p>

<p>Please note that I’m working on a new set of classes. One for the best
	basics course I can offer and one for those who wish to really dive into
	their intuitive abilities. I’ll send an email out with my newsletter list
	when these are available as well as their cost.</p>

<p>Wishing you a bright and wonderful day! Thank you for looking into my work!
	Blessings!</p>
