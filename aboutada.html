<p>I am Spirit taught Medium and Chakra Energy Healer. This means
	that when the time was right, Creator lead me to the path which would
	be most beneficial for me to learn what my abilities were and how they
	worked. This was very important to me because for so much of my life I
	had been in complete denial of these amazing gifts. As the old saying
	goes, ""When the timing is right, the Teacher appears..." and that is
	so true for my life.</p>
<p>The turning point came when I could no longer deny, ignore or
	abandon what Creator so Graciously gave me. There was a stubborn streak
	still in me and to this day it holds true that I require confirmatory
	"proof" from those on the other side in my readings. These pieces of
	information come to me in connecting to present day circumstances for
	those here, the aches, pains, agues and personality traits of those
	communicating from the other side and pieces of information necessary
	for me to help those here know their loved ones are just a blink away.</p>
<p>As the years have progressed, many people have also asked me
	questions about their own personal experiences and abilities. Due to my
	great desire to learn as in depth as much as possible my own abilities
	and shed the fears I had with them from old dogma and beliefs I had
	growing up, like you had or have perhaps, I've felt called to also
	teach and aid those with a desire to understand their intuitive
	abilities too. This I do by private session as well as VERY small web
	classes held monthly. To find out more email me at
	adamay@naturallistening.com or click here for my Monthly newsletter.</p>
<p>My Spirit training has also been in relation to our Chakras.
	Those amazing orbs of energy that are what I call "Soul Connectors"
	that manage our energies and emotions in our bodies and our lives. A
	few years ago My Spirit Guides told me I would be doing work that would
	help others to clear emotional traumas from their Chakras. This I now
	do as well with the system that My Guides gave me years ago. Each
	clearing is a little different per person as well as per session if
	someone chooses to have more than one session. The catharsis for
	release is one of the most exceptional experiences I've ever had.</p>
<p>What I love about energy work of any kind, is that Distance Makes
	No Difference. With the aid of the telephone, computer and web, via
	Skype, I now can do my work with individuals Internationally as well as
	all over the US and Canada. Readings and all services are through
	Appointment. To make an appointment with me email me at
	<a href="mailto:adamay@naturallistening.com">adamay@naturallistening.com</a>
	with your days available, time zone in
	which you live and what type of appointment you wish.</p>
