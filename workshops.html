<p align="left"><strong>Know Your Claires - Basics of Intuitive Understanding </strong></p>
<p>Often our abilities have a way of showing up when we least expect it, especially if we have pushed them down years before. In this course, Ada will be guiding you in her own unique way, through each of your abilities, how they may work for you and how you can expand your senses to help you understand and work more comfortably with this very special and natural part of who you are.  This class is a two to three hour long session.  You will receive Ada's personally designed pdf manual covering all four of the major psychic abilities as well as tips for grounding, clearing and shielding your personal energy.  You will have the opportunity to discuss your experiences and to ask questions either during the session or as things come through for you that you need help with over time.</p>  
<p>You will receive two manuals designed by Ada to help you understand, make notes and review at your own convenience.  </p>

<p align="left"><strong>Individual Intuitive Instruction - One on one classes with Ada </strong></p>
<p>Our Intuitive Abilities are unique for each of us and because of this Ada understands that at times individuals have the need and desire for personal one on one sessions to help them learn, understand and become comfortable with their abilities.  Very similar to the joint classes Ada offers, these sessions are based on the individual's abilities and needs.  Ada will take the time to learn your current intuitive strengths and how they have been occurring for you as a gauge on how to help you the most.  She will also use her intuitive senses to help you understand any blockages or related concerns and how they may be affecting your using your abilities to the fullest.  In these individual sessions you will be able to ask specific questions you may have but never had the ability to ask someone personally.</p>
<p>Each Instruction time is between forty five minutes and an hour, normally. </p>
<p>As with the joint class, you will receive Ada's specially prepared PDF manuals to review and go through at your own pace.  </p>
<p>There are no minimum or maximum number of lessons you can take in this manner.  Each of us learns in our own individual style and pace.  This is why Ada has done her best to design this in a way that can help you to go forward at your own pace and in your own time. </p>
