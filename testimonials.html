<p>I will definitely contact Ms. Brown in the future. The reading I got verified several things for me. I got guidance in handling an upcoming event, and was comforted by receiving verifications from loved ones as well as close friends. Ms. Brown was extremely conscientious in making sure I received an audio CD of the reading. Her method of delivery of identifying my Spiritual contacts was smooth, soothing, and gentle. I am glad to have contacted her and thankful for her abilities.</p>

<p>I am happy to highly recommend Ada May Brown for intuitive energy work. When I considered working with a healer, there were two main questions I needed to ask: 1) is the healer good (competent/professional/available), and 2) is the chemistry right? Ada May was 100% on both counts. Her approach as a healer, of listening intuitively before applying  treatment, is both unique and effective. And her style is warm, emotionally supportive, and overflowing with love. Over the course of the hour, I received a head-to-toe chakra clearing and a spot-on intuitive reading that hit straight at the root of what was going on. I was relieved of severe shoulder and scapula pain that had been plaguing me for six months. Her incredible commitment to my growth and healing was unmistakable as she expertly conducted the session. I left feeling energized and invigorated, not to mention completely blown away by her intuitive abilities. Again, I highly recommend Ada May Brown - you'll be lucky if you can book her.</p>
