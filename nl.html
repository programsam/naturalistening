	<h2>Natural Listening</h2>

                                    <p> Natural Listening is just that - Listening to the natural spiritual side of ourselves.  It is just as natural as walking, eating and breathing.  We are just used to using our "traditional" senses far more than our intuitive senses.</p>
                                    <p>There are a number of ways we all are intuitive and everyone is intuitive to one degree or another.  You may feel like in your life you have been "the psychic turnip" of the world.  That is not true, it may just be that what you are accustomed to for yourself you just don't see as intuition coming through.  There are a myriad of ways intuition comes through to us, here are just a few: 
                                    </p>
                                    <ul>
                                      <li>Intuition is a gut feeling.</li>
                                        <li>Intuition can be smelling roses in winter when nothing is blooming.</li>
                                        <li>Intuition is putting those extra socks and a shirt in your hubby's over night bag 'cause you just have that feeling.</li>
                                        <li>Intuition is telling your wife to bring her spare set of keys to work and you don't know why.</li>
                                        <li>Intuition is turning around and going back because something is nagging you to do so.</li>
                                        <li>Intuition can also be feeling joy, sadness, anger, fear, peace, calm and love.</li>
                                        <li>Intuition is also seeing things out of the corner of your eyes. </li>
                                    </ul>                                    <p>It is a myriad of experiences that are special to each of us but collectively is known as intuition.Natural Listening to me is listening to your intuition as well as the signs Spirit/God gives you along your path.  Intuition is just as normal and as natural as the grass growing in your yard.  Your hair, feet and fingers are a natural part of you and so is your intuition.  Your intuition is a God Given Gift and nothing but Love can give something so amazing, so wonderful and so beautiful.    </p>
                                    <p>Welcome to my website, Natural Listening.  This is where hopefully you can find the information you are seeking, a refuge from your doubts and if I am blessed to do so, help you along your path in life understanding another amazing part of you - your intuition.</p>
