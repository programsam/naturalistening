	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
	  	<p>This was given to me by my Guides over the summer of 2011. Many people have found it an amazing and wonderful clearing. My unique system clears your chakra and pathways and grounds your energy. In this session I will guide you in using your intuition to open your chakras one by one. Together we will remove the unneeded energies, ideas and thought-forms that form chakra blockages. By the end of this album your chakras and pathways will be completely clear and open. Clear chackras and pathways enable you to proceed on your chosen life path and remove the mental and spiritual energy that holds you back. I hope this this album proves helpful and healing to you.</p>

    	<h3 class="panel-title">Guided Cord Cutting Personal Session</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
    	<p>Sometimes in our lives we unknowingly hold onto Psychic Energy Cords long after things have dissolved in our personal life regarding an issue, personal relationship or event.  In addition sometimes we need to "cut cords" in order to move ahead in our lives.  Ada will assist you with a  personal guided review of your energy cords, teach you what cords are and help you remove any cords you need to have removed at the time.  Often, this will enable you to feel the almost immediate benefits of removing old and unneeded energy attachments that have been holding on.  Each session is between half an hour and 45 minutes long.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
    	<p>If you would like to make a donation to let me help someone who may not be able to afford a course and need it, you can.  I know people get funny about money and donations especially regarding spiritual matters, but we all have to deal with this issue as it comes to us.  For months I have debated as to whether to do this and have found that it is for some to accept and others to deny and even possibly get angry with - I really do understand.  I don't charge for readings of those who have lost a loved one in combat or as a result of conflict/war, and there are times I don't charge for helping over the phone.  This is just one way to keep the energy flowing and helping me to help others.  Blessings and thank you so much for understanding  - Ada</p>
