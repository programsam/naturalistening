<a name="top"><h2>Like A Butterfly</h2></a>
<p>Recently I've taken the time meditate on so many things due to a
	close passing. So often I think of those in Spirit to be so much like
	butterflies. They are now able to lead an afterlife that is beyond the
	limits of this world. They can fly with Love from here with us to
	beyond the gates of Heaven which is Love to me. Years ago I was Blessed
	by a close encounter with a newly released "Butterfly" named Marty. I
	had volunteered to speak with Marty "Soul to Soul" as he was in a coma
	readying or his most amazing journey, that of crossing the Great Veil
	between life as we know it and the afterlife. When his brother called
	me to say that he had "gone" I went outside on my patio and cried with
	relief for him and his family. Within seconds this newly released Soul
	we knew as Marty gave me what I call "Angel Hugs" and went through me
	with such Peace, Joy and Love that I will never forget it all the days
	of my life.</p>
<p>He was now in a realm where he could "dance" with me for a brief
	moment and be with those whom he loved almost a thousand miles away. He
	was so amazing in coming to me that morning! It was a communication
	between Souls and things he said to me in emotion held me on such a
	deep level that day that it took me hours to regain my footing in this
	world in which we live.</p>
<p>Like my late and wonderful Father, when he crossed, I felt a Love
	and Peacefulness beyond our human description. Butterflies of the
	highest realm indeed!</p>
