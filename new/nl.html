<a name="top"><h2>Natural Listening</h2></a>
<p>To me Natural Listening is just that, listening to the most
	natural part of ourselves, our intuition. We are all intuitive. As I
	tell my students, there is no such thing as a human psychic turnip. We
	all have gut feelings, hints and little things that happen in our
	lives. These things we often don't pinpoint as being our intuition, but
	they are.</p>
<p>Here are just a few ways your intuition may be working with you
	too.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do you have Deja vu experiences at times?</li>
	<li>Can you see just the right shades of a color to match with
		something you already have?</li>
	<li>Do you sometimes hear sounds you cannot explain like whispers
		just out of range, bells, or other things?</li>
	<li>Have you seen things out of the corner of your eye you've
		tried to explain away but can't?</li>
	<li>Have you ever walked into a room, house or building and felt
		strong emotional vibes or just felt there was something odd in that
		space but you couldn't put your finger on it?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all signs of your intuition at work for you believe it
	or not!</p>
<p>One of the things that I most fervently want you to understand is
	that these and other experiences are all perfectly "normal" and
	natural. They are a part of you as much as the physical self you were
	born with! There are ways you can understand these amazing abilities
	even more, as well as shield from energies you want to keep away from
	your energy field.</p>
