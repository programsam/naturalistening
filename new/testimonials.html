<p>I just had a wonderful, magical, healing/psychic session with
	Ada May Brown. Ada is so gifted she was able to delve into a
	few religious lifetimes that has had a major impact on my
	current life time. Ada May advised me of what energy centers
	were being affected, she performed healing energy to these
	past lifetimes and energy centers. She made numerous
	suggestions on how to move forward, along with her gentle
	guidance. I am most grateful for Ada Mae Brown, truly a
	soul blessed with grace and generosity of spirit. All I
	can say is Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.</p>

<p>I recently had the pleasure of having a reading done for me by
	AdaMay. Her reading was honest and gave me exactly what guidance I
	needed for my own spiritual advancement. Thanks to AdaMay I could feel
	my loved ones love surround me and I now know that I'm not alone and
	that my loved ones are with me. I also know now that my loved ones are
	no longer in pain. I will definitely be contacting AdaMay in the
	future.</p>

<p>Ada surprised me w/ the depth of the reading and what those
	spirits who had crossed had to say to me. She was patient as I took
	notes and repeated words (skype was not working well at my end). I
	found Ada as real as can be and talented beyond measure. I have since
	passed her name around to other interested parties. Word of mouth is
	the highest form of praise in my book. I will be talking to Ada again!</p>

<p>I will definitely contact Ms. Brown in the future. The reading I
	got verified several things for me. I got guidance in handling an
	upcoming event, and was comforted by receiving verifications from loved
	ones as well as close friends. Ms. Brown was extremely conscientious in
	making sure I received an audio CD of the reading. Her method of
	delivery of identifying my Spiritual contacts was smooth, soothing, and
	gentle. I am glad to have contacted her and thankful for her abilities.</p>

<p>I am happy to highly recommend Ada May Brown for intuitive energy
	work. When I considered working with a healer, there were two main
	questions I needed to ask: 1) is the healer good
	(competent/professional/available), and 2) is the chemistry right? Ada
	May was 100% on both counts. Her approach as a healer, of listening
	intuitively before applying treatment, is both unique and effective.
	And her style is warm, emotionally supportive, and overflowing with
	love. Over the course of the hour, I received a head-to-toe chakra
	clearing and a spot-on intuitive reading that hit straight at the root
	of what was going on. I was relieved of severe shoulder and scapula
	pain that had been plaguing me for six months. Her incredible
	commitment to my growth and healing was unmistakable as she expertly
	conducted the session. I left feeling energized and invigorated, not to
	mention completely blown away by her intuitive abilities. Again, I
	highly recommend Ada May Brown - you'll be lucky if you can book her.</p>

<p> I lost my husband 5 months ago by Suicide. I felt it was time to try and
	communicate. It was literally nothing I expected. She was providing evidence
	that my husband is still around by only facts I knew and actually things I
	did prior to placing my phone call there is no way she could have known.
	She's a blessing to me that she can communicate and relay the messages I
	need and the inside jokes to make me laugh from him. I can't wait to have
	another moment with her and my husband. She's the REAL DEAL!!
	..so to thankful I found her!  </p>
