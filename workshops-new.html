    	<p>If you would like to make a donation to let me help someone who may not be able to afford a course and need it, you can.  I know people get funny about money and donations especially regarding spiritual matters, but we all have to deal with this issue as it comes to us.  For months I have debated as to whether to do this and have found that it is for some to accept and others to deny and even possibly get angry with - I really do understand.  I don't charge for readings of those who have lost a loved one in combat or as a result of conflict/war, and there are times I don't charge for helping over the phone.  This is just one way to keep the energy flowing and helping me to help others.  Blessings and thank you so much for understanding  - Ada</p>
