<h2>Like A Butterfly</h2>
<br>
<p>I like to think of our spirits or souls after we pass like a butterfly after it pupates. When we are here in our bodies going about our daily routines, we are limited in how and where we travel by the physical realities we face. When we pass over to the other side of life, we like the butterfly, don’t have as many limitations on how we move or where we go in our journey. </p>

<p>Think about it. A caterpillar is limited to a certain area as it grows and matures. It can only go along its limited environment due to its very nature of being arboreal or terrestrially limited. Those little legs can only get it so far. What about our area? Mine is my home and surrounding area. What is yours? You go by car, train, bus or plain like I do. We cannot be in two places at the same time. We are limited by our physical conditions, our body’s ability to move.</p>

<p> So when the caterpillar is done being a caterpillar, it pupates and metamorphoses into a butterfly. The transformation takes a little time. Soon or late the butterfly emerges. It dries its wings and takes to flight. It can go up and down and over to where ever it chooses to go. It is no longer bound by the “rules” of the caterpillar’s mobility.</p>

<p>Like that butterfly, when a person leaves the earthly existence, I believe it is no longer
encumbered by the rules of earthly movement. The laws of time and space don’t seem to exist
on the other side of life. To us there will seem a time when they are “getting their sea legs” or becoming used to how to communicate. They are going from our regular forms of communication to a more thought based communication because their energy now vibrates at a higher frequency. </p>

<p> You will note that at some point you and a relative may have an occurrence at almost the exact same time or even at the same time. That is because they can be in both places at once. Time and space for whatever the mechanics of it, doesn’t have the same restrictions for them as it does for us. We can be thinking of them and in an instant there can be a sign from them right in front of us. </p>

<p>There are various ways they can communicate with us and to a larger degree that is discussed on the “Making Connections” page. That being said, please say a prayer and a thank you, because that Love of Spirit makes it all possible. You can’t go wrong with a thank you in this world, no matter where no matter when.</p>
