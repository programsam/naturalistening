<h2>Making Connections</h2>

<p>When we think of spirit communication or ADC (After Death Communication) we often think of using a medium.  Various pictures of a medium may or may not come into our minds about what a medium really is.  A medium looks just like anyone else, regardless of how unique and wonderful their talents may be.  We just have the ability to perceive through our natural abilities and training to understand the messages we are given.  
</p>
<p>We can often train ourselves in the ways that our loved ones use to communicate.  Using our natural abilities, we can discern when a loved one is or isn't connecting with us from Spirit.  There are times when we need to work with a good medium but there are other times when just using our natural abilities is enough.</p>
<p> "How do those in Spirit communicate with an average person?"  you may be asking.  Simple they can use a variety of ways to get our attention and often are far more subtle than we would normally guess.     </p>
<p>Spirit folk can get our attention with songs, headlines on a magazine  moving our keys, purses, pens or glasses for a short time, making electrical things go on and off, or both.  They can have us smell their cigars, garden roses, favorite dish, perfume or aftershave.  They can sometimes be seen out of the corner of our eye.
      </p>
<p>There are also such things as dream visitations, like the two my dad has given me over the years or when my Angels have paid me a visit in dreams.  Don't let anyone let you talk yourself out of the loving reality that is a dream visit.  How do you know if it was a visit?   If you are ever so blessed as to have a dream visit, you will know it is real by how fabulous you felt when you woke up.  You will feel as light as air and so good it will take a bit to get you to "come back to earth."</p>
<p>There is one thing not to expect from our loved ones who have passed.  That is unless you are in a show production, don't expect them to "go Hollywood" on you and just show up.  It isn't like the TV and movies portray.  It is really much different.

<p>A very important thing to note is that when we are grieving it is very difficult for them to get through.  One lady I heard from a while back asked me how long until her loved one could communicate with her?   It had only been a week since her daughter had passed.  Usually they try as soon as possible, but OUR grief is hard to get through in most circumstances.   We sometimes have to be more patient with ourselves than with them.

<p>There are various ways to learn how to develop your listening skills for understanding your loved ones in Spirit.  You can take one of my classes, or a number of other talented and gifted mediums classes.  There are things on the web as well as books.  Don't be discouraged if someone's method doesnt work for you.  Just say to yourself, "well that just wasn't me" and ask Spirit to help you find the right resource.  I did just that and was given the right places to go.  
              </p>
<p>There are two great books on my books page with ways to help yourself receive your own messages.  One book is by Suzane Northrop, well known and very gifted medium "A Medium's Cookbook: Recipes for the Soul."  The other book is by John Holland who is an author and very gifted medium that book is "Psychic Navigator."
