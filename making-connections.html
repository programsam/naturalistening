<h2>Making Connections</h2>

<p>When we think of Spirit Communication or ADC (After Death
	Communication) we often will think of going to a medium. I recommend
	waiting until you've gone at least 3 to 6 months before you do this.
	This allows you to go through the grieving process that is all too
	necessary in our life here on earth. Allowing yourself to wait will
	give you the ability to assess and understand what a Psychic-Medium
	like myself will give you the information from your loved one in the
	after life.</p>

<p>Do you need to wait that long to expect signs or messages from
	those who have passed? NO! We often may get signs, messages and
	sometimes even surprise readings from those who have crossed very
	recently. They try so hard to get through to us in order for us to know
	that they are all right and now watching over us!</p>

<p>
	We usually just have to become familiar and train ourselves in the ways
	they communicate in order to know that it's them. We can also ask for
	verification that it IS them by saying "OK if this is you, do this
	again in a way that I <strong>know</strong> it can be no one else but
	you!" Then wait for the magic.
</p>

<p>Here is a good example from my own personal experience.</p>
<h3>Dimes....</h3>
<p>Several years ago when I was first developing my intuitive
	abilities, I started receiving dimes in odd places. When I would pick
	one up and hold it I would hear "Buddy can you spare a dime?" from an
	old Depression Era song. My Dad was a young man in the Great
	Depression.</p>
<p>After a while I felt it was Dad, but I wanted confirmation and in
	a way that only he would give. I said "Daddy, if this is you, I want
	you to send me a dime somewhere I know it can be no one else BUT you!"</p>
<p>A week or so later I'm helping my oldest daughter to move from
	one apartment to another. I went to the truck rental place with her to
	rent this van so that we could move everything in one haul. It was a
	Saturday and as is normal for those types of rental places they were
	beyond busy. As we waited our turn I walked around the store and saw
	all the packing and moving materials that anyone could want or need.</p>
<p>It was then that my eyes caught the sight of a dime laying
	PERFECTLY place in the center of one side of a pallet of moving
	materials. When I saw that bright shiny dime I got goose bumps and KNEW
	it had to be Daddy. The reason being all the clues fit...</p>
<ul>
	<li>We were moving his first Granddaughter, my daughter to her new
		flat... He was watching!</li>
	<li>The dime was perfectly centered on the wooden palette's bottom
		front plank... Dad was a carpenter (there's the wood link) and knew
		how much precision counted, hence smack in the middle of the board.</li>
	<li>We moved A LOT when I was a child. Every few years Dad would
		finish remodeling a house and then we would be on to the next house to
		do... Moving was my next big sign.</li>
</ul>
<p>I still smile so big and grand when I think of that day... All of
	my daughters and I together with their Granddad in Spirit and he gave
	me a dime!</p>
<p>Listen for the signs they will give you. Don't over expect
	certain things or make ways of their communicating with you too
	structured or obsessive. Relax with it and Celebrate when you get those
	amazing times of contact with those on the other side!</p>
