<span id='ucsgtc' style='display: none'>
<p><strong>Understanding Chords is combined with the Shielding and Grounding</strong>.  This tele-class takes approximately 2 hours.  

<br>The first part of this course is designed to aid you in understanding the various kinds of chords, how to tighten down, remove and eliminate their attachment to you.  The second part of the course aids you in finding the right grounding and shielding technique for you and your intentions.  Each person is different so no two people have identical ways of shielding and grounding.  Grounding and shielding both help you to relax and focus by clearing out energies from your system in such a way that they you know how to prevent or remove connections once you realize they have occurred.

<p><strong>NOW AVAILABLE! Ada May's New Chakra Clearing Technique on CD or digitally! </strong>
 <p>This was given to me by my Guides over the summer of 2011. Many people have found it an amazing and wonderful clearing. My unique system clears your chakra and pathways and grounds your energy. In this session I will guide you in using your intuition to open your chakras one by one. Together we will remove the unneeded energies, ideas and thought-forms that form chakra blockages.

If you would like to make a donation to let me help someone who may not be able to afford a course and need it, you can.  I know people get funny about money and donations especially regarding spiritual matters, but we all have to deal with this issue as it comes to us.  For months I have debated as to whether to do this and have found that it is for some to accept and others to deny and even possibly get angry with - I really do understand.  I don't charge for readings of those who have lost a loved one in combat or as a result of conflict/war, and there are times I don't charge for helping over the phone.  This is just one way to keep the energy flowing and helping me to help others.  Blessings and thank you so much for understanding  - Ada
