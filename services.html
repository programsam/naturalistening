    	<h3 class="panel-title">Guided Cord Cutting Personal Session</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
    	<p>Sometimes in our lives we unknowingly hold onto Psychic Energy Cords long after things have dissolved in our personal life regarding an issue, personal relationship or event.  In addition sometimes we need to "cut cords" in order to move ahead in our lives.  Ada will assist you with a  personal guided review of your energy cords, teach you what cords are and help you remove any cords you need to have removed at the time.  Often, this will enable you to feel the almost immediate benefits of removing old and unneeded energy attachments that have been holding on.  Each session is between half an hour and 45 minutes long.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="panel-body">
    	<p>If you would like to make a donation to let me help someone who may not be able to afford a course and need it, you can.  I know people get funny about money and donations especially regarding spiritual matters, but we all have to deal with this issue as it comes to us.  For months I have debated as to whether to do this and have found that it is for some to accept and others to deny and even possibly get angry with - I really do understand.  I don't charge for readings of those who have lost a loved one in combat or as a result of conflict/war, and there are times I don't charge for helping over the phone.  This is just one way to keep the energy flowing and helping me to help others.  Blessings and thank you so much for understanding  - Ada</p>
